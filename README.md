# Excel-Challenge


1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

From the first pivot column we could tell that the crowdfunding for film & video, music and theater were greatly successful. They had a much higher success rate than fail rate. From pivot column 2., we could tell that further looking into the sub-categories of the crowdfunding, plays were significantly successful, while food trucks almost had an equal amount of successful and failed crowdfunding campaigns. From the third pivot table we can make out that crowdfunding campaigns are most successful during the months of April through July, and the campaigns have the most failures between the months of June and August. 

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?

For pivot tables 1 & 2, under the status of live there were quite a few missing values which doesnâ€™t give an accurate comparison to between the parent categories and the sub-categories. 

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

We can use an individual bar chart to further look at failed and successful for the parent category to get a better idea which type of crowdfunding campaign does the best. We can create a line chart based on year to get a better idea of what year was successful/failed to get an idea on performance.  A bar chart based on the parent category/ sub-category with the date (year and month) to get an idea of which type of campaign performs better based on time of  year or year.
